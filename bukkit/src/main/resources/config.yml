#                  CyAnnouncer Configuration
# ===================================================================
#
# Plugin Author: cydev-id
# Plugin Version: 1.0.2
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# This plugin will display announcements with an independent cycle for each world.
#
# 1. A world with specific messages (e.g., 'world_the_end') will have a cycle of:
#    (Global Message -> Specific End Msg 1 -> Global Message -> ...)
#
# 2. A world without specific messages will ONLY cycle through global messages.
#
# ===================================================================

# DO NOT CHANGE THIS.
config-version: 2

# Interval in SECONDS between each announcement for a world.
interval: 60

# Prefix appearing before each announcement line.
# Set to "" to disable.
prefix: "&e[&l!&r&e] &r"

# (NEW) --- SETTINGS SECTION (Feature #3) ---
settings:
  # Set to true to pick a random message from all available messages (global + specific) each cycle.
  # Set to false to use the default sequential cycle (default).
  random: false

# --- ANNOUNCEMENTS SECTION ---
announcements:
  # --- GLOBAL ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # These messages will be part of the cycle in ALL worlds.
  # Use "all" in the 'worlds' list.

  # Example 1: Standard CHAT message (default type)
  - worlds:
      - "all"
    lines:
      - "&eDon't forget to vote for the server every day!"
      - "&fUse the command &b/vote&f to get rewards."

  # Example 2: Global ACTIONBAR message with a SOUND (Features #2 & #5)
  - worlds:
      - "all"
    type: "ACTIONBAR" # (NEW) Type: CHAT, ACTIONBAR, or TITLE
    sound: "ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP" # (NEW) Sound from Bukkit's Sound Enum
    lines:
      - "&aWelcome! Check out our store at &b/buy"
      # Note: ACTIONBAR only uses the first line.

  # --- WORLD-SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # These messages will ONLY appear in the specified worlds.

  # Example 3: TITLE message for a specific world (Feature #2)
  - worlds:
      - "world_the_end"
    type: "TITLE"
    lines:
      - "&5Welcome to The End!" # Line 1 is the main TITLE
      - "&7Be careful of the Dragon!" # Line 2 is the SUBTITLE

  - worlds:
      - "world_nether"
    lines:
      - "&cIt's hot in here! Make sure to bring fire resistance potions."
      - "&fDon't hit a Piglin without preparation!"
