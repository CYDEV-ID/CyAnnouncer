#
# Plugin Author: cydev-id
# Plugin Version: 1.0.1
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# This plugin will display announcements with an independent cycle for each world.
#
# 1. A world with specific messages (e.g., 'world_the_end') will have a cycle of:
#    (Global Message -> Specific End Msg 1 -> Global Message -> ...)
#
# 2. A world without specific messages will ONLY cycle through global messages.
#
# ===================================================================

# Interval in SECONDS between each announcement for a world.
interval: 60

# Prefix appearing before each announcement line.
# Set to "" to disable.
prefix: "&e[&l!&r&e] &r"

# --- ANNOUNCEMENTS SECTION ---

  # --- GLOBAL ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # These messages will be part of the cycle in ALL worlds.
  # Use "all" in the 'worlds' list.
