# Default interval in SECONDS between each announcement for a server.
# For example, if a player is on the Survival server, they will see a
# new message from their announcement cycle every 60 seconds.
interval: 60

# The prefix that appears before every line of an announcement.
# Set to "" (empty quotes) to disable the prefix entirely.
prefix: "&e[&l!&r&e] &r"

# (NEW) --- SETTINGS SECTION (Feature #3) ---
settings:
  # Set to true to pick a random message from all available messages (global + specific) each cycle.
  # Set to false to use the default sequential cycle (default).
  random: false

# ===================================================================
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# This plugin uses an intelligent, independent cycle system for each server.
#
# 1.  A server with its own specific messages (e.g., 'survival') will create a
#     unique cycle: (Global Message -> Specific Survival Msg 1 -> Specific Survival Msg 2 -> Global Message -> ...)
#
# 2.  A server WITHOUT specific messages (e.g., 'lobby') will only cycle
#     through the global messages: (Global Message 1 -> Global Message 2 -> Global Message 1 -> ...)
#
# Each server's cycle runs independently and does not affect the others.
#
announcements:
  # --- GLOBAL ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # These messages will be part of the cycle for EVERY server.
  # To make a message global, add "all" to its 'servers' list.

  # Example 1: Standard CHAT message (default)
  - servers:
      - "all"
    lines:
      - "&eDon't forget to vote for our server every day!"
      - "&fUse the command &b/vote&f to get rewards."

  # Example 2: Global ACTIONBAR message with a SOUND (Features #2 & #5)
  - servers:
      - "all"
    type: "ACTIONBAR" # (NEW) Type: CHAT, ACTIONBAR, or TITLE
    sound: "entity.player.levelup" # (NEW) Sound (use Minecraft key, e.g., 'block.note_block.pling')
    lines:
      - "&dCheck out our webstore for exclusive ranks and items!"
      # Note: ACTIONBAR only uses the first line.

  # --- SERVER-SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # These messages will ONLY be shown to players on the specified servers.
  # They will be inserted into the cycle after a global message.

  # Example 3: TITLE message for Skyblock/Oneblock (Feature #2)
  - servers:
      - "oneblock"
      - "skyblock" # You can target multiple servers with the same message block.
    type: "TITLE"
    lines:
      - "&aWelcome to the Sky!" # Line 1 is the main TITLE
      - "&fType &b/is&f to start your adventure." # Line 2 is the SUBTITLE

  - servers:
      - "oneblock"
      - "skyblock"
    lines:
      - "&bLooking for a team? Use &a/team&b to cooperate with others!"

  # Example 4: Standard CHAT message for Survival
  - servers:
      - "survival"
    lines:
      - "&cWatch out! PvP is enabled in the wilderness."
      - "&fClaim your land using a Golden Shovel to stay safe."
