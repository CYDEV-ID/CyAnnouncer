# Plugin Version: 1.0.2
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# This plugin will display announcements with an independent cycle for each server.
#
# ===================================================================

# Default interval in SECONDS between each announcement for a server.
interval: 60

# The prefix that appears before every line of an announcement.
# Set to "" (empty quotes) to disable the prefix entirely.
prefix: "&e[&l!&r&e] &r"

# (NEW) --- SETTINGS SECTION (Feature #3) ---
settings:
  # Set to true to pick a random message from all available messages (global + specific) each cycle.
  # Set to false to use the default sequential cycle (default).
  random: false

# --- ANNOUNCEMENTS SECTION ---
announcements:
  # --- GLOBAL ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # To make a message global, add "all" to its 'servers' list.

  # Example 1: Standard CHAT message (default type)
  - servers:
      - "all"
    lines:
      - "&eDon't forget to vote for the server every day!"
      - "&fUse the command &b/vote&f to get rewards."

  # Example 2: Global ACTIONBAR message (Feature #2)
  - servers:
      - "all"
    type: "ACTIONBAR" # (NEW) Type: CHAT, ACTIONBAR, or TITLE
    # sound: "..." # (Note: Sound is NOT supported on BungeeCord)
    lines:
      - "&aWelcome! You are on server &e%server_name%&a!"
      # Note: ACTIONBAR only uses the first line.

  # --- SERVER-SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # These messages will ONLY be shown to players on the specified servers.

  # Example 3: TITLE message for a specific server (Feature #2)
  - servers:
      - "lobby"
    type: "TITLE"
    lines:
      - "&bWelcome to the Lobby!" # Line 1 is the main TITLE
      - "&7Check out the new gadgets!" # Line 2 is the SUBTITLE

  # Example 4: Original Survival message
  - servers:
      - "survival"
    lines:
      - "&cWatch out! This is a PvP-enabled server."
